This is a web data base which I made for my mom, so not English available at the moment, contact me if you are interested.
What this does is import Excel data to a database, then it can be edited from a web browser.
Some Javascript and CSS were implemented for styling.
For this to run locally, I have mvoed bootstrap files and references to the static folder.
