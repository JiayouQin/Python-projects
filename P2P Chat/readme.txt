This is a working in progress P2P chat app based on python

Planning features for this app is RSA encryption and P2P communication

Update:
V0.1:
A very simple Gui with basic chat function, transmission is still plain text at this stage.


How to use:
Use as a server: enter "y" when asked if this is a server, this requires port fowarding and a public ip adress
Use as a client: change ip and port to the server's adress, enter "n" when asked if this is a server, the client will automatically connect to the ip and port which is "hard wired" into the code
Use a server relay(Chatroom): edit the ip adress and port, run the relay and connect as clients.
