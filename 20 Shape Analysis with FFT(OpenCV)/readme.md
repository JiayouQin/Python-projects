by transforming polar to cartesian the shape of a object could be seen as a wave function.
We can then use fourier transform to analyze it's frequency.
By applying a low-pass filter we get a smoothened function, by subtracting this function we get the noise which is the flaw on the shape.
By transforming this back we can also get the location of the flaw.
